I am a meat-based stochastic parrot interested in making metal-based stochastic parrots better at following the distributions of meat-based ones. I think AGI & Emacs are cool. 

....

ok, fine, here's a more serious bio

I’m broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Speech Language Sample Analysis; recently, I’ve been digging into 1) building better tools for language and speech processing to make state-of-the-art classic NLP tasks accessible and useful 2) using and designing improved mechanistic approaches for large language model decoding and understanding and 3) exploring sequential approaches to language modeling to make language models more robust and useful.
