I am a human interested in linguistic analysis, L2 learning, and user interfaces. AGI & Emacs are cool. I run Shabang, do do research in NLP and education, and am working for TalkBank on the intersection between speech and language. Iâ€™m currently doing my undergrad at Stanford, where I write some code for Stanza, a NLP package for many human languages, and a rover that we are sending to Antarctica.
