It’s the idea that one’s goal in life (call it happiness, well-being, whatever,) is to pursue greater gestalts—as opposed to pleasure, which most people pursue intuitively. Greater gestalts are “deeper, broader insights,” and the pursuit is that of knowledge, meaning, and self-expression. This may seem arbitrary, but I’ve found this formulation makes good judgments and clarifies the value and harm of certain activities, like demoing builds, modern art, and info hazards. I wrote an &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exr0n/wilderness/refs/heads/main/essays/24fa_humpl136_gestalt_perfectionism.pdf">essay&lt;/a> on this for my philosophy class last quarter, but I wanted a self-contained nugget to refer back to—that’s this post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stack Safety and CPS In Common Lisp</title><link>https://shedding.bike/stack-safety-and-cps-in-common-lisp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shedding.bike/stack-safety-and-cps-in-common-lisp/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note&lt;/strong>: this is a translation of a Common Lisp file I sent to my
sister one day a couple months ago when she was asking why her Emacs Lisp function
was hitting a recursion limit. I was fresh off of CPS lab and proceeded to nerd
out. Also, any hate of &lt;code>setf&lt;/code> in here is a comedic exaggeration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a very simple tour of using Common Lisp to write some simple factorial
and is-even functions. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to functional programming or Lisp you might
find it interesting, but this is mostly to test out this website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Markdown Syntax Guide</title><link>https://shedding.bike/markdown-syntax-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shedding.bike/markdown-syntax-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a quick cheatsheet, check out &lt;a href="https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide">https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
